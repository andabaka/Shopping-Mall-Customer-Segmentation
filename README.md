Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, enabling businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor their approach to different segments. In this project, we apply K-means clustering to group shopping mall customers based on various features, such as age, annual income, and consumer code.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and includes information about shopping mall customers. The data is preprocessed and utilized for K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.

Dataset Source: Kaggle - Shopping Mall Customer Segmentation
Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. The process involves stages such as business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. K-means clustering is applied to identify clusters within the customer data.
