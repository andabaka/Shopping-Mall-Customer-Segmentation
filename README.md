# Shopping-Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation of shopping mall customers with k-means clustering

# Overview
This repository contains codes in form of a Rmarkdown file and resources for performing customer segmentation on a shopping mall customer database. The segmentation is done using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

    
## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, enabling businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their approach to different segments. In this project, we apply K-means clustering to group shopping mall customers based on various features, such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and includes information about shopping mall customers. The data is preprocessed and utilized for K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.

## Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. The process involves stages such as business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. K-means clustering is applied to identify clusters within the customer data.

## Results
The results are visualized and interpreted using plots and interactive tools. A summary of the clusters and their characteristics are provided.
